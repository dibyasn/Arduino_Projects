## üì¶ Projects Overview

### 1. üêç Snake Game

- **Description**: A classic Snake Game implemented using an OLED display and a joystick. Control the snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.
- **Features**:
  - Joystick control for game navigation
  - OLED display (0.96") for game visuals
  - Incremental difficulty as the snake grows
- [View Project Files](./üêçSnake_Game/README.md)

### 2. Automated Watering System

- **Description**: A smart irrigation system that automatically waters plants based on soil moisture levels. This project uses sensors to monitor soil moisture and controls a water pump via a relay to water plants when necessary.

- **Features**:
  - Soil moisture sensor for monitoring water levels
  - Water pump controlled via a relay module
  - Audio feedback using DFPlayer Mini for notifications
  - OLED display animations for visual feedback (crying face for dry soil, smiling face for well-watered plants)
- [View Project Files](./Automated_Watering_System/README.md)

### 3. üîß Magic Switchboard

- **Description**: A fascinating switchboard puzzle that involves swapping positions of switches and light caps while maintaining the rule that a switch always controls its corresponding light.
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic assignment of switches to LEDs
  - Visual feedback with LEDs
  - A fun and interactive puzzle experience
- [View Project Files](./Magic_Switchboard/README.MD)

### 4. Child Safety System

- **Description**: A system designed to enhance child safety in washrooms using an SOS button, timer-based alerts, and an ultrasonic sensor for monitoring occupancy.
- **Features**:
  - SOS button for emergency alerts
  - Timer to detect prolonged occupancy
  - Ultrasonic sensor for real-time presence detection
  - Visual and audio alerts for notifications
- [View Project Files](./Child_Safety_System/readme.md)
  
### 5. 7x5 NeoPixel Custom Display

- **Description**: Web-controlled 35-LED matrix display (7x5 grid) powered by ESP32, offering interactive visualization and pattern creation capabilities.
