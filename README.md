## üì¶ Projects Overview

### 1. üêç Snake Game

- **Description**: A classic Snake Game implemented using an OLED display and a joystick. Control the snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.
- **Features**:
  - Joystick control for game navigation
  - OLED display (0.96") for game visuals
  - Incremental difficulty as the snake grows
- [View Project Files](./üêçSnake_Game/README.md)

### 2. Automated Watering System

- **Description**: A smart irrigation system that automatically waters plants based on soil moisture levels. This project uses sensors to monitor soil moisture and controls a water pump via a relay to water plants when necessary.
- **Features**:
  - Soil moisture sensor for monitoring water levels
  - Water pump controlled via a relay module
  - Audio feedback using DFPlayer Mini for notifications
  - OLED display animations for visual feedback (crying face for dry soil, smiling face for well-watered plants)
- [View Project Files](./Automated_Watering_System/README.md)

### 3. üîß Magic Switchboard

- **Description**: A fascinating switchboard puzzle that involves swapping positions of switches and light caps while maintaining the rule that a switch always controls its corresponding light.
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic assignment of switches to LEDs
  - Visual feedback with LEDs
  - A fun and interactive puzzle experience
- [View Project Files](./Magic_Switchboard/README.md)

## ‚ú® Features Across Projects

Each project is designed with clear code structure and easy-to-understand instructions. Common features include:

- **Interactive Games**: Fun and engaging games implemented using Arduino, OLED displays, and joystick controls.
- **Audio & Visual Feedback**: Projects often include features such as audio feedback (using the DFPlayer Mini) and visual feedback through OLED displays or LEDs.

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while replicating the projects, you can refer to the troubleshooting sections in the individual project folders. Additionally, feel free to open an issue in this repository for support.

## üôå Acknowledgments

This repository is a result of continuous learning and experimentation with Arduino and its vast ecosystem of sensors, modules, and controllers. I would like to express my gratitude to the incredible Arduino community, whose shared knowledge and open-source contributions have been an invaluable resource. A special thanks to the creators of the libraries and tools used across the projects, making innovation accessible to everyone.
